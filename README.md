### Summary
Prefcards helps surgical teams maintain consistent and accurate surgical preference cards.  Preference cards play an integral role in the lead up to any surgery; they help the team properly prepare equipment, supplies, medications, etc. based on the preferences of the surgeon on the case. A number of hospitals use outdated systems for tracking and updating preference cards, leading to inconsistencies from one case to the next and creating problems when new staff members join the team. Prefcards' strength is in its simplicity. View, create and edit preference cards easily through an intutive interface.
